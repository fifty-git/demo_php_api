Before shipping your flowers, we prepare them for their journey with proper hydration methods. <em>If your flowers appear sleepy and thirsty after their journey, it is <strong>absolutely NORMAL</strong>. </em>The ideal date to have your Tulips delivered is 1 to 2 days prior to your event. If you choose to receive them with more days anticipation, please dry store them in a flower refrigerator until two days before the event. Two days prior to your event, just follow these simple steps and the flowers will bloom delightfully.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove flowers from box by cutting any straps. Do not remove the rubber bands holding the flowers together in a bunch.&nbsp;</li>\n<li> Fill containers with at least 4 inches of fresh, cool water.&nbsp;</li>\n<li> Cut bottom of stems diagonally approximately at least and inch from bottom under running water with sharp scissors or knife. This will create a fresh surface to absorb water.&nbsp;</li>\n<li> Immediately after cutting, place the stems in the prepared water. Please note that your Tulips will continue to grow for about a day after they have been put in water. <em></em></li>\n<li>Allow flowers at least 4 hours to hydrate well. Your tulips will continue to grow once placed in water. It is best to wait at least 8 hours before arranging.&nbsp;</li>\n<li> Keep flowers away from direct sunlight, drafts or excessive heat.&nbsp;</li>\n<li> Place Tulips in a place with even light, or rotate frequently as Tulips will turn to face the light.&nbsp;</li>\n<li> Change water every 24 hours to keep flowers fresh. This will keep the water from becoming contaminated with bacteria that blocks the flower\'s availability to absorb water. Assure that your flowers have sufficient water. The flowers will drink an exceptionally large amount of water upon arrival.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em><strong>Your tulips will arrived closed, but once placed in water the stem will continue to grow and the head will bloom substantially.&nbsp;Tulips also have a natural bend. </strong>If Tulip stems are slightly bowed, trim stem tips and roll the Tulips in newspaper with the paper extending above the flower tops, but not covering the lower third of the stems. Place them upright in water with a source of light directly above them.&nbsp;Tulip heads naturally follow the light, so placing a light directly above them will help to straighten a bent stem.</em></p>\n<p>Remember that exposing flowers to warm environments (outside, a hot room, etc) will help the flowers to bloom, and storing your Tulip flowers in a cooler environment will slow down the opening process.</p>\n<p>Tulips are sensitive to ethylene (which comes from fresh vegetables and fruits, especially bananas) which makes them open faster, but also age faster. Depending on your preference, place them away from or near fresh fruit and vegetables. Do not put Tulips close to a television.</p>', '<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">FiftyFlowers uses FedEx or UPS for priority overnight delivery service.

Our Garden Roses are shipped in special packaging that may or may not include water boxes, water tubes or wet foam.

If you do not have flower food, it can be purchased at any local florist.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Remove any leaves that fall below the water line. Not removing the leaves may cause bacteria to form and shorten the Rose\'s life.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Using sharp scissors or a knife, cut the stems diagonally under running water approximately one inch from each stem\'s bottom edge.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Immediately after cutting, place the stems in the prepared water.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Allow flowers at least 4 hours to hydrate well. Garden Roses may take up to 12 hours to properly hydrate. Leave the plastic or cardboard packaging around the blooms for a minimum of 4 hours. This will allow the Roses sufficient time to hydrate properly.</li>\n<li>Keep flowers away from direct sunlight, drafts or excessive heat.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>To keep the Garden Roses fresh, change the water every 24 to 48 hours or when the water becomes cloudy.

Upon removal of the protective packaging, remove any brown or discolored guard petals. It is not uncommon to remove an average of 5 to 10 petals per bloom.</p>\n<p>Remember that exposing Garden Roses to warmer environments (outside, a hot room, etc) will help the flower bloom, and storing your Roses in a cooler environment will slow down the opening process.</p>\n<p><input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\" /><input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\" /></p>', '<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">FiftyFlowers uses FedEx or UPS for priority overnight delivery service.

Place them upright in water with a source of light directly above them.&nbsp;Tulip heads naturally follow the light, so placing a light directly above them will help to straighten a bent stem.</em></p>\n<p>Remember that exposing flowers to warm environments (outside, a hot room, etc) will help the flowers to bloom, and storing your Tulip flowers in a cooler environment will slow down the opening process.</p>\n<p>Tulips are sensitive to ethylene (which comes from fresh vegetables and fruits, especially bananas) which makes them open faster, but also age faster. Depending on your preference, place them away from or near fresh fruit and vegetables. Do not put Tulips close to a television.</p>', '<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">FiftyFlowers uses FedEx or UPS for priority overnight delivery service.

For your convenience, a Care Instructions card and CD will accompany your flowers. Please follow the care instructions to ensure beautiful wedding flowers.<br />1) Upon delivery, remember to bring flowers indoors immediately. Use scissors to cut and remove all outer plastic straps. Next, carefully remove the top of the box and inspect your flowers. Verify that the contents match your order. If you have any questions about your wedding flowers, please contact us immediately at 1-877-50-ROSES (877-507-6737).<br />2) Your wedding arrangements are firmly attached to an inner tray which you will need to remove. The following will be easier if another person assists you. To remove the tray, use one hand to firmly hold the outside of the box, and use your other hand to pull upwards on the tray until it is free from the outer structure.&nbsp; At this point you can throw away the outer portion of the box.<br />3) Remove the arrangements from the box, starting with the smaller pieces first. Take caution not to bump the pieces against the side of the box or against the other flower arrangements.<br />Boutonnieres and Corsages. When removing the boutonniere or corsage, remove both the arrangement and the water tube together. To do this, place one hand on the bottom of the water tube and the other hand on the upper lip of the tube. In one firm yet gentle motion, press both upward on the bottom of the water tube and pull upward on the top of the tube so that the water tube gently slides out. Do not push or pull on the arrangement itself. <br />Bouquets and Centerpieces.. Before removing the large arrangements, fill up vases or containers with 3 to 4 inches of cool water. Be sure to add flower food and mix it thoroughly. You will need one vase or container for each large arrangement.&nbsp; <br />Now remove the larger bouquets one by one from the box. For each bouquet, firmly hold its stems in one hand and unfasten the Velcro strap that secures it in place with the other hand. Take caution not to bump the flowers against the side of the box or any other arrangements.<br />4) Hydrate your flowers.<br />Boutonnieres and Corsages. Holding the water tube in one hand, gently pull back the soft plastic top of the water tube. Do not remove the arrangement from the plastic top.&nbsp; In one hand you will be holding the water tube, and in the other hand, the arrangement with the plastic top still attached.<br />Remove the cotton wrap around the flower stems and fill the water tube with fresh water that has been mixed with flower food.&nbsp; Place the arrangement back in the tube and seal it. Do not at any time push, pull, or apply pressure to the flower arrangement. Doing so may potentially damage the flowers.<br />Repeat this procedure with all the small arrangements.<br />Place the boutonnieres and corsages in a refrigerator away from fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables release gases which may damage your flowers.&nbsp; Also ensure that the refrigerator&rsquo;s temperature is above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Freezing temperatures will also damage your flowers.<br />Bouquets and Centerpieces. Remove all wrapping, including the plastic bag AND the sponge. These kept your bouquet hydrated throughout the delivery process.&nbsp; Throw away the paper, the bag, and the sponge.&nbsp; Immediately place the bouquet in one of the previously prepared vases or containers. Make the sure water level is lower than the ribbon. You do not want the water touching the ribbon or any part of the flower decoration. Repeat these steps for each remaining large arrangement. Add water daily as needed Do NOT put the bouquets or centerpieces in the refrigerator. It is not necessary!<br />5) Store your flowers in a cool dry location, with a room temperature between 35 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The cool the temperature, the fresher your arrangements will be until ready to use. Avoid extreme temperatures &ndash; do not freeze your flowers! Also, avoid placing your flowers in direct sunlight and near drafts.</p>', '<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">FiftyFlowers uses FedEx or UPS for priority overnight delivery service.

It is important for you to gently pull off the anthers from the stalk as the flower is opening. If you leave the anthers attached to the stalk, then a yellow pollen will form. This yellow pollen will stain everything it touches! It will stain your hands, the flower, and clothing. If pollen stains the bloom, remove with a pipe cleaner. If pollen stains your clothing, remove with sticky tape (DO NOT APPLY WATER).</p>\n<p><strong>TO OPEN YOUR LILIES:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You will need to remove all leaves which can potentially touch the water to prevent bacteria from growing in your flower buckets. In order to do so, leave those leaves which you will want to incorporate into your arrangements in tact on the stem and remove&nbsp;those leaves which are extra. Cut the stems diagonally to the desired length. Place the cut flowers into 5-7 inches of warm water in a clean bucket. As the bloom opens, remove the orange stamens from the center of the bloom and drop them into the water (a professional florist trick which causes a natural occurrence that will help the lilies to bloom more quickly). After your Lilies have been in water for approximately 1 day, the blooms are ready to start flowering. In the event that you would like to speed up the blooming process here are 2 tips. Start with Tip #1 and in the event this does not work, try Tip #2.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip #1</strong> Carefully pry open the very tip of the flower bloom, by lightly splitting the tips open. &nbsp;You might hear a weird noise when doing this, which is natural. &nbsp;Also take care not to bruise the body of the bloom by applying too much pressure. Once you have achieved opening the tip the slightest amount, place your lilies in a warm environment overnight and the blooms should pop open.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Tip #2</strong> If flowers have a very closed bloom, you can place plastic bags over the blooms and set them in a warm bathroom and start a steaming shower. &nbsp;The enclosed heat will provoke the flower to bloom.</p>\n', '<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">FiftyFlowers uses FedEx or UPS for priority overnight delivery service.

Before shipping your flowers, we prepare them for their journey with proper hydration methods. For your convenience, a Care Instructions card and CD will accompany your flowers. Please follow the care instructions to ensure beautiful wedding flowers.<br />1) Upon delivery, remember to bring flowers indoors immediately. Use scissors to cut and remove all outer plastic straps. Next, carefully remove the top of the box and inspect your flowers. Verify that the contents match your order. If you have any questions about your wedding flowers, please contact us immediately at 1-877-50-ROSES (877-507-6737).<br />2) Your wedding arrangements are firmly attached to an inner tray which you will need to remove. The following will be easier if another person assists you. To remove the tray, use one hand to firmly hold the outside of the box, and use your other hand to pull upwards on the tray until it is free from the outer structure.&nbsp; At this point you can throw away the outer portion of the box.<br />3) Remove the arrangements from the box, starting with the smaller pieces first. Take caution not to bump the pieces against the side of the box or against the other flower arrangements.<br />Boutonnieres and Corsages. When removing the boutonniere or corsage, remove both the arrangement and the water tube together. To do this, place one hand on the bottom of the water tube and the other hand on the upper lip of the tube. In one firm yet gentle motion, press both upward on the bottom of the water tube and pull upward on the top of the tube so that the water tube gently slides out. Do not push or pull on the arrangement itself. <br />Bouquets and Centerpieces.. Before removing the large arrangements, fill up vases or containers with 3 to 4 inches of cool water. Be sure to add flower food and mix it thoroughly. You will need one vase or container for each large arrangement.&nbsp; <br />Now remove the larger bouquets one by one from the box. For each bouquet, firmly hold its stems in one hand and unfasten the Velcro strap that secures it in place with the other hand. Take caution not to bump the flowers against the side of the box or any other arrangements.<br />4) Hydrate your flowers.<br />Boutonnieres and Corsages. Holding the water tube in one hand, gently pull back the soft plastic top of the water tube. Do not remove the arrangement from the plastic top.&nbsp; In one hand you will be holding the water tube, and in the other hand, the arrangement with the plastic top still attached.<br />Remove the cotton wrap around the flower stems and fill the water tube with fresh water that has been mixed with flower food.&nbsp; Place the arrangement back in the tube and seal it. Do not at any time push, pull, or apply pressure to the flower arrangement. Doing so may potentially damage the flowers.<br />Repeat this procedure with all the small arrangements.<br />Place the boutonnieres and corsages in a refrigerator away from fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables release gases which may damage your flowers.&nbsp; Also ensure that the refrigerator&rsquo;s temperature is above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Freezing temperatures will also damage your flowers.<br />Bouquets and Centerpieces. Remove all wrapping, including the plastic bag AND the sponge. These kept your bouquet hydrated throughout the delivery process.&nbsp; Throw away the paper, the bag, and the sponge.&nbsp; Immediately place the bouquet in one of the previously prepared vases or containers. Make the sure water level is lower than the ribbon. You do not want the water touching the ribbon or any part of the flower decoration. Repeat these steps for each remaining large arrangement. Add water daily as needed Do NOT put the bouquets or centerpieces in the refrigerator. It is not necessary!<br />5) Store your flowers in a cool dry location, with a room temperature between 35 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The cool the temperature, the fresher your arrangements will be until ready to use. Avoid extreme temperatures &ndash; do not freeze your flowers! Also, avoid placing your flowers in direct sunlight and near drafts.</p>', '<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">FiftyFlowers uses FedEx or UPS for priority overnight delivery service.

For your convenience, a Care Instructions card and CD will accompany your flowers. Please follow the care instructions to ensure beautiful wedding flowers.<br />1) Upon delivery, remember to bring flowers indoors immediately. Use scissors to cut and remove all outer plastic straps. Next, carefully remove the top of the box and inspect your flowers. Verify that the contents match your order. If you have any questions about your wedding flowers, please contact us immediately at 1-877-50-ROSES (877-507-6737).<br />2) Your wedding arrangements are firmly attached to an inner tray which you will need to remove. The following will be easier if another person assists you. To remove the tray, use one hand to firmly hold the outside of the box, and use your other hand to pull upwards on the tray until it is free from the outer structure.&nbsp; At this point you can throw away the outer portion of the box.<br />3) Remove the arrangements from the box, starting with the smaller pieces first. Take caution not to bump the pieces against the side of the box or against the other flower arrangements.<br />Boutonnieres and Corsages. When removing the boutonniere or corsage, remove both the arrangement and the water tube together. To do this, place one hand on the bottom of the water tube and the other hand on the upper lip of the tube. In one firm yet gentle motion, press both upward on the bottom of the water tube and pull upward on the top of the tube so that the water tube gently slides out. Do not push or pull on the arrangement itself. <br />Bouquets and Centerpieces.. Before removing the large arrangements, fill up vases or containers with 3 to 4 inches of cool water. Be sure to add flower food and mix it thoroughly. You will need one vase or container for each large arrangement.&nbsp; <br />Now remove the larger bouquets one by one from the box. For each bouquet, firmly hold its stems in one hand and unfasten the Velcro strap that secures it in place with the other hand. Take caution not to bump the flowers against the side of the box or any other arrangements.<br />4) Hydrate your flowers.<br />Boutonnieres and Corsages. Holding the water tube in one hand, gently pull back the soft plastic top of the water tube. Do not remove the arrangement from the plastic top.&nbsp; In one hand you will be holding the water tube, and in the other hand, the arrangement with the plastic top still attached.<br />Remove the cotton wrap around the flower stems and fill the water tube with fresh water that has been mixed with flower food.&nbsp; Place the arrangement back in the tube and seal it. Do not at any time push, pull, or apply pressure to the flower arrangement. Doing so may potentially damage the flowers.<br />Repeat this procedure with all the small arrangements.<br />Place the boutonnieres and corsages in a refrigerator away from fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables release gases which may damage your flowers.&nbsp; Also ensure that the refrigerator&rsquo;s temperature is above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Freezing temperatures will also damage your flowers.<br />Bouquets and Centerpieces. Remove all wrapping, including the plastic bag AND the sponge. These kept your bouquet hydrated throughout the delivery process.&nbsp; Throw away the paper, the bag, and the sponge.&nbsp; Immediately place the bouquet in one of the previously prepared vases or containers. Make the sure water level is lower than the ribbon. You do not want the water touching the ribbon or any part of the flower decoration. Repeat these steps for each remaining large arrangement. Add water daily as needed Do NOT put the bouquets or centerpieces in the refrigerator. It is not necessary!<br />5) Store your flowers in a cool dry location, with a room temperature between 35 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The cool the temperature, the fresher your arrangements will be until ready to use. Avoid extreme temperatures &ndash; do not freeze your flowers! Also, avoid placing your flowers in direct sunlight and near drafts.</p>', '<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">FiftyFlowers uses FedEx or UPS for priority overnight delivery service.

Flowers need room to breath and bloom; over stuffing buckets with too many flowers, can cause damage as well as prevent proper blooming.<br />&nbsp;<br />Exposing flowers to warm environments (outside in the shade, a warmer room, etc) will help the flowers to bloom, and storing your flowers in a cooler environment will slow down the blooming of your flowers.<br />&nbsp;<br />Flowers wilt and fade prematurely because water is prevented from reaching the top blooms due to bacteria blockage in the stem. To minimize bacteria, keep your buckets and/or vases with clean fresh water.</p>', '<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">FiftyFlowers uses FedEx or UPS for priority overnight delivery service.

Assure that your flowers have sufficient water.

Before shipping your flowers, we prepare them for their journey with proper hydration methods. <em>If your flowers appear sleepy and thirsty after their journey, it is <strong>absolutely NORMAL</strong>. </em>The ideal date to have your Tulips delivered is 1 to 2 days prior to your event. If you choose to receive them with more days anticipation, please dry store them in a flower refrigerator until two days before the event. Two days prior to your event, just follow these simple steps and the flowers will bloom delightfully.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove flowers from box by cutting any straps. Do not remove the rubber bands holding the flowers together in a bunch.&nbsp;</li>\n<li> Fill containers with at least 4 inches of fresh, cool water.&nbsp;</li>\n<li> Cut bottom of stems diagonally approximately at least and inch from bottom under running water with sharp scissors or knife. This will create a fresh surface to absorb water.&nbsp;</li>\n<li> Immediately after cutting, place the stems in the prepared water. Please note that your Tulips will continue to grow for about a day after they have been put in water. <em></em></li>\n<li>Allow flowers at least 4 hours to hydrate well. Your tulips will continue to grow once placed in water. It is best to wait at least 8 hours before arranging.&nbsp;</li>\n<li> Keep flowers away from direct sunlight, drafts or excessive heat.&nbsp;</li>\n<li> Place Tulips in a place with even light, or rotate frequently as Tulips will turn to face the light.&nbsp;</li>\n<li> Change water every 24 hours to keep flowers fresh. This will keep the water from becoming contaminated with bacteria that blocks the flower\'s availability to absorb water. Assure that your flowers have sufficient water. The flowers will drink an exceptionally large amount of water upon arrival.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em><strong>Your tulips will arrived closed, but once placed in water the stem will continue to grow and the head will bloom substantially.&nbsp;Tulips also have a natural bend. </strong>If Tulip stems are slightly bowed, trim stem tips and roll the Tulips in newspaper with the paper extending above the flower tops, but not covering the lower third of the stems. Place them upright in water with a source of light directly above them.&nbsp;Tulip heads naturally follow the light, so placing a light directly above them will help to straighten a bent stem.</em></p>\n<p>Remember that exposing flowers to warm environments (outside, a hot room, etc) will help the flowers to bloom, and storing your Tulip flowers in a cooler environment will slow down the opening process.</p>\n<p>Tulips are sensitive to ethylene (which comes from fresh vegetables and fruits, especially bananas) which makes them open faster, but also age faster. Depending on your preference, place them away from or near fresh fruit and vegetables. Do not put Tulips close to a television.</p>', '<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">FiftyFlowers uses FedEx or UPS for priority overnight delivery service.
